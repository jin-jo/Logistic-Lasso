# Logistic-Lasso
## Logistic Regression Model based on Lasso(Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator)

- I made functions to compute the logistic Lasso using coordinate descent on the penalized iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm. 
- I built the helper functions so that it can be used in a `tidymodels` workflow. 
- I wrote a short vignette that explains how to use my function within a `tidymodels` workflow to perform classification. This includes how to tune the model.
